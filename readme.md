The Village
=====================

A simulation of a coastal village, based on nico muhly's score "I drink the air before me". So far, an excuse to try my hand at and practice several technologies and techniques I'm interested in: BDD/TDD via mocha/chai, coffeescript and grunt. Probably also going to use that to fuel some sort of visualisation and who knows what else.
